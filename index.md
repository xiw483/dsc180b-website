# Multiple Testing Method with Empirical Null Distribution in Leukemia Studies
By Raymond Wang and Jacob Benson

## Introduction
Multiple testing analysis is a commonly used statistical practice in genetic research, often used to separate significant genes from a large pool of candidates. For example, in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the multiple testing approach can be used to identify particular genes responsible for a certain disease. This is achieved through simultaneously conducting a large number of hypothesis tests between the control and experimental groups on each individual gene. With each hypothesis test’s t-statistics recorded, we can search through the data for anomalies and identify genes that might be correlated with the disease of our interest. 

Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) and Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) are two common types of leukemia. According to the [Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh](https://www.chp.edu/our-services/cancer/conditions/leukemia/types), ALL acounts for about 75 percent of childhood leukemia. It affects the growth of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cells that is normally responsible for one's immunity, causing it to overproduce and crowding out other types of blood cells. On the other hand, AML causes the overproduction of granulocytes, another type of white blood cells. Identifying genes responsible for each of the two types of leukemia helps us to better understand their pathology as well as allows build statistical models adaptable for future studies and applications.
